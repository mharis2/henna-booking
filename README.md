# Henna by Tayyaba

Henna by Tayyaba is a web application designed to streamline the process of booking appointments for a henna artist business. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for customers to book appointments according to their preferences. 

## Project Aim

The primary aim of this project was to create a digital solution that simplifies the process of booking appointments, allowing the artist and customers to manage and schedule appointments with ease. It was essential to ensure that the application was intuitive to use for a variety of users, hence a strong emphasis was placed on UI/UX design.

The application also provides information about the artist and the services available, serving as a comprehensive platform for the artist's business. 

## Technologies Used

The application uses a range of modern web development technologies:

- **Frontend:** The frontend of the application was built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application also utilizes CSS for styling to ensure a visually pleasing and intuitive interface.

- **Backend:** The backend of the application is built with Node.js and Express.js. Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

- **Database:** MongoDB, a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program, is used for data storage. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

- **Other Libraries/Tools:** The application also utilizes several other tools for specific functionalities. Nodemailer is used for sending emails regarding bookings, Axios is used for making HTTP requests, React Router is used for routing in the React application, and React Select is used for the time selection feature.

Henna by Tayyaba is an example of a full-stack web application that brings together various technologies to create an efficient and effective solution.
